# My Hacker Workspace

An Arch Linux based workspace for penetration testing, load testing, OSINT, network scanning, and more.

### Setting Up

Checkout the repository and set the `NOVA_WORKSPACE` environment variable.

### Provision Novix Remote

The `novix` provision scripts are my way of quickly bootstrapping a fresh Arch Linux image with all of my magic. 

If you intend to make changes to the base install please see the following script:

``` 
$NOVA_WORKSPACE/home/novix/bin/novix-packages
```
